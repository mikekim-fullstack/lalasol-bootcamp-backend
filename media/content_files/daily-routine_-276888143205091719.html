        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            The interviewer is trying to assess the kind of work environment you are familiar with. Is it fast pace or
            slow pace? If it is a fast pace, how do you manage your priorities and time? From your answer, the
            interviewer can probably get a good sense on how aggressive you are with your work schedule.


        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            Do not simply enumerate the laundry list that you do everyday. That is not what the interviewer is asking
            for. Instead, focus on how much time you spend on technical work, how much on meetings. Do not forget the
            time you spend to think and find creative new ways to solve problems. This is also a good opportunity to
            demonstrate how you keep up with whatâ€™s new in the industry and commit to learn new things. For example,
            attending meetups, reading blogs, etc.
        </div>
        <div class="img"><img src="../images/routine.png"></div>
        <p>In terms of priorities, you may want to cover short-term priorities and medium-term priorities. What tools do
            you use to keep your day organized? Purely on calendar? Or something else. For medium-term, do you use
            something like OKRs to keep your priorities structured? Anyway, explain clearly the tools you are using.</p>

        <p>When balancing different priorities, please note timeline is not the only factor that drives priority. In the
            technology world, quality is definitely another key dimension to consider and cover. To launch the right
            product, in some companies, it is perfectly fine to delay. Make it clear that you manage priorities
            considering all factors, not just the deadline.</p>
        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>Get into too much detail about your daily routine detail. Focus on key things, such as how much time
                    do you spend on writing code each day, how much time in meetings.</li>
                <li>Be too rigid about your priority. The reality is that in most cases, you prioritize based on what is
                    needed by your work and your family.</li>
                <li>Do not cover the time you spend to catch up with the industry and learn new things. It is important
                    for you to show you are a lifetime learner.</li>

            </ul>

        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>How do you find time to keep yourself updated with what is going on?</li>
                <li>How do you prioritize between timeline, quality, and work life balance?</li>
