        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for: </strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            We have all experienced situations where people share different opinions and are stuck in stalemate since
            nobody can convince anyone. In such situations, it is often the case that proceeding with any option is
            better than being stuck. Strong leaders seek to make compromises in such cases so that the team can proceed.
            It is a critical skill to make the right compromises in any type of organizations. When asking this
            question, the interviewers are trying to assess your flexibility and your creativity to make the right
            compromises to resolve conflicts.

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            Without saying, you need to use the STAR method to describe the situation, what you did and the result.
            Simply making a compromise is never a strong leadership. You need to showcase why making a compromise was
            the right thing to do in this circumstance, what you did to break the stalemate and how you subsequently
            resolved the conflict. Make sure you lay the foundation, why different people have different views and how
            everyone believes theirs is correct. Explain what you did to make sure everyone understood the situation,
            the compromises that the team had to make and articulate the actions that made a difference.

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>You did not go through a thorough analysis or compromised and ended up in a situation that is not
                    necessarily right for the organization.</li>
                <li>You made compromises because you had to, such as pressure from your manager. This is the chance to
                    show your action has made a difference and was not to please someone.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>Share one experience where you stepped back and found a better solution.</li>
                <li>Share an experience that solved a problem by collaborating with others.</li>
