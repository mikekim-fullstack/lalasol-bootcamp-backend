            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            <strong>Question:</strong> Two of your tech leads escalated to you that the other party is not
            collaborative. What would you do?
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> As managers, part of your job is to handle
            escalations, step in when necessary, challenge the individuals to figure out solutions in other cases. In
            this question, the interviewer is looking for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your management style towards escalations, and</li>
            <li>Your ability to help the team to resolve conflicts</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong> Best practice to answer:</strong> If you are an experienced manager, you must have encountered this
            situation. While a general rule of thumb is to bring everyone together and talk it openly, it is also true
            that it is case by case and you have to use different tactics depending on the situation. A strong response
            will lay out some fundamental principles on how you typically handle escalations and conflicts within your
            team, and explain how you will handle differently for a few common scenarios.</p>
        <p>A powerful example is how your intervention resulted into a stronger chemistry between the two individuals
            and how they became better leaders.</p>

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Act as a messenger between the two parties. If you are entangled in the verbal exchanges it is almost
                certain you will have a hard time resolving the conflict. The likely outcome is that everyone will be
                disappointed.</li>
            <li>Simply force the two members to solve the issue by themselves, without stepping in as needed.</li>
            <li>Downplay the challenging nature and only suggest superficial solutions such as open communication.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>How do you resolve conflicts within your team?</li>
            <li>How do you handle escalations?</li>
            <li>Tell me a time that you had to give tough feedback to someone.</li>
        </ul>
