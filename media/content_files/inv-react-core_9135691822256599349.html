                    React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. 
                    It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. 
                    React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

                    The major features of React are:
                        - It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
                        - Supports server-side rendering.
                        - Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
                        - Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

                    - There are two possible ways to create a component.
    
                    ----------------
                    1. Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component. 
                    - Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:
                    
                    function Greeting({ message }) {
                      return &lt;h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}&lt;/h1>
                    
                    }
                    ----------------
                    2. Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. 
                    The above function component can be written as:
                    
                    class Greeting extends React.Component {
                      render() {
                        return &lt;h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}&lt;/h1>
                      }
                    }

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-markup">
                    If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use function component. 
                    However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-markup">
                    React.PureComponent is exactly the same as React.Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate() method for you. 
                    When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. 
                    Component on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. 
                    Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    - State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. 
                    - We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.
    
                    - Let's create an user component with message state,
    
                    class User extends React.Component {
                        constructor(props) {
                            super(props)
    
                            this.state = {
                            message: 'Welcome to React world'
                            }
                        }
    
                        render() {
                            return (
                            &lt;div>

                        }
                    }
    
                    <img src="./images/state.jpg"/>
    
                    - State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. i.e, 
                    - It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.
    
                    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:
                    
                    Pass custom data to your component.
                    Trigger state changes.
                    Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.
                    For example, let us create an element with reactProp property:
                    
                    &lt;Element reactProp={'1'} />
                    This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

                    Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

                    this.state.message = 'Hello world'
                    Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. 
                    When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.
                    
                    // Correct
                    this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })

                <h5>13) How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?<span
                        class="float-right badge badge-pill badge-primary">JSX</span></h5>
                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:
    
                    1. Binding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.
                    
                        class Component extends React.Componenet {
                            constructor(props) {
                                super(props)
                                this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
                            }
                            
                            handleClick() {
                                // ...
                            }
                        }
    
                    2. Public class fields syntax: If you don't like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks.
                    
                        handleClick = () => {
                            console.log('this is:', this)
                        }
                        &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>
                            {'Click me'}
                        &lt;/button>
    
                    3. Arrow functions in callbacks: You can use arrow functions directly in the callbacks.
                    
                        &lt;button onClick={(event) => this.handleClick(event)}>
                            {'Click me'}
                        &lt;/button>
    
                    Note: If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. 
                        In those cases, it is preferred to go with .bind() or public class fields syntax approach considering performance.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters:
    
                        &lt;button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
                    This is an equivalent to calling .bind:
                    
                        &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
                    Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as array function

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    A key is a special string attribute you should include when creating arrays of elements. 
                    Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
    
                    Most often we use ID from our data as key:
                    
                        const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
                        &lt;li key={todo.id}>
                            {todo.text}
                        &lt;/li>
                        )
    
                    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:
                    
                        const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
                        &lt;li key={index}>
                            {todo.text}
                        &lt;/li>
                        )
    
                    Note:
                    
                        1. Using indexes for keys is not recommended if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
                        2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on list component instead of li tag.
                        3. There will be a warning message in the console if the key prop is not present on list items.

                <h5>17) How to create refs? <span class="float-right badge badge-pill badge-primary">refs</span></h5>
                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                There are two approaches
    
                    1. This is a recently added approach. Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property within constructor.
                    
                        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                        constructor(props) {
                            super(props)
                            this.myRef = React.createRef()
                        }
                        render() {
                            return &lt;div ref={this.myRef} />
                        }
                        }
    
                    2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element accessed as follows,
                    
                        class SearchBar extends Component {
                        constructor(props) {
                            super(props);
                            this.txtSearch = null;
                            this.state = { term: '' };
                            this.setInputSearchRef = e => {
                                this.txtSearch = e;
                            }
                        }
                        onInputChange(event) {
                            this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
                        }
                        render() {
                            return (
                                &lt;input
                                    value={this.state.term}
                                    onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
                                    ref={this.setInputSearchRef} />
                            );
                        }
                        }
                    3. You can also use refs in function components using closures. 
                    
                    Note: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach

                    The Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.

                        2. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:
    
                        1. Mounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.
                        
                        2. Updating: In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.
                        
                        3. Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.
                        
                    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows
                        
                        1. Render The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.
                        
                        2. Pre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().
                        
                        3. Commit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting.

                    We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

                    Children is a prop (this.prop.children) that allow you to pass components as data to other components, 
                    just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.
    
                    There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. 
                    These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.

                        class="float-right badge badge-pill badge-primary">react</span></h5>
                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until super() method 
                    has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. 
                    The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props 
                    in your child constructors.
    
                    Passing props:
                    
                        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                            constructor(props) {
                                super(props)
                            
                                console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                            }
                        }
    
                    Not passing props:
                        
                        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                            constructor(props) {
                                super()
                            
                                console.log(this.props) // prints undefined
                            
                                // but props parameter is still available
                                console.log(props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                            }
                            
                            render() {
                                // no difference outside constructor
                                console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                            }
                        }
                    The above code snippets reveals that this.props is different only within the constructor. 
                    It would be the same outside the constructor.

                    It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements.

                    Below are the list of reasons,
    
                        - Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
                        - Some CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
                        - The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.

                    If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. 
                    You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. 
                    But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. 
                    There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, 
                    log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
    
                    A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info) or static getDerivedStateFromError() :
                    
                        class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
                            constructor(props) {

                                // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
                                logErrorToMyService(error, info)
                            }
                            
                            static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
                                // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
                                return { hasError: true };
                            }
                            
                            render() {
                                if (this.state.hasError) {
                                    // You can render any custom fallback UI

                    After that use it as a regular component:

                    The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for server-side rendering (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:
    
                        renderToString()
                        renderToStaticMarkup()
                        
                    For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call renderToString to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.
                    
                        // using Express

                    For Style we can css modules, css preprocessers or css in JS.
    
                    The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. 
                    This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.
    
                        const divStyle = {

                    Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.
    
                    In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. 
                    This limits the optimizations that React can do.

                    It is recommended to avoid all uses of forceUpdate() and only read from this.props and this.state in render().

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Redux follows three fundamental principles:
    
                        1. Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
                        2. State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
                        3. Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.

                    mapStateToProps() is a utility which helps your component get updated state 
                    (which is updated by some other components):
    
                        const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
                            return {

                            }
                        }
    
                    mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which will help your component to fire an 
                    action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):
                    
                        const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
                            return {

                    and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.

                    This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. 
                    You could reduce a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state.

                    Component is a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.
                    Container is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. 
                    Containers subscribe to Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:
    
                        1. Components: Used for dumb components unaware of Redux.
                        2. Containers: Used for smart components connected to Redux.
                        3. Actions: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.
                        4. Reducers: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.
                        5. Store: Used for store initialization.
    
                    This structure works well for small and medium size apps.

                    redux-saga is a library that aims to make side effects (asynchronous things like data 
                    fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) 
                    in React/Redux applications easier and better.
    
                    It is available in NPM:

                        Actions are plain JavaScript objects or payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. 
                        They are the only source of information for the store. 
                        Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.
    
                        For example, let's take an action which represents adding a new todo item:
                        
                            {
                                type: ADD_TODO,
