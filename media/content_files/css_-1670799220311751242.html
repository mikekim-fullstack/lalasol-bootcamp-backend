CSS selector specificity is a rule that determines which styles should be applied to an HTML element 
when multiple selectors target the same element and conflict with each other. 
It's a way to assign a weight or priority to selectors in order to resolve conflicts and determine the final styles.

Specificity is calculated based on various components of a selector, such as the type selector, class selector, ID selector, and inline styles. 
Each of these components has a value assigned to it , and when selectors are compared, the one with the higher specificity value wins and its styles are applied.

The specificity value is calculated using four parts:
    0. !important (wins among those)
    1. Inline Styles                               - 1000
    2. ID selectors                                -  100
    3. Classes, Attributes and Pseudo-classes      -   10
    4. Elements and Pseudo-elements                -    1 

    e.g.)
    #div-1 > .second-block > .text {
        color: blue
    } => 100+10+10 = 120
    
    .first-block > #div-2 > #paragraph {
        color: red
    } => 10+100+100=210 (WINS)

When comparing selectors, the specificity value is calculated for each component, and the selector with the highest total specificity wins. 
For example, a selector with an ID and a class will have a higher specificity than a selector with only a class.
If two or more selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the stylesheet takes precedence. 
However, inline styles always override any conflicting styles, regardless of their specificity.
Understanding CSS selector specificity is crucial for resolving conflicts and applying styles accurately when dealing with complex stylesheets. 
By properly structuring and organizing selectors, you can ensure consistent and predictable styling across your web pages.

                    <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
In CSS, the "float" property is used to position elements horizontally within their containing parent element. When an element is floated, 
it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and positioned to the left or right of its parent or preceding sibling elements.

The "float" property accepts three possible values: "left," "right," and "none." 
When an element is set to "left" or "right," it will be moved to the respective side and any following content will flow around it. 

If multiple elements are floated, they will be positioned adjacent to each other in the order they appear in the HTML markup.

It's important to note that floated elements are taken out of the normal document flow, which can affect the layout of surrounding elements. 
To prevent this, you can use the "clear:both" property to specify that no element should be allowed to float on the left or right side of the cleared element.

                    <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
In CSS, the z-index property controls the stacking order of elements on a web page along the z-axis, which is the depth or "third dimension" of the page.
It determines how elements are layered and displayed on top of each other.

The z-index property accepts an integer value, where higher values bring elements closer to the viewer and lower values push elements farther back. 
Elements with higher z-index values will appear in front of elements with lower values.

                    <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that describes how elements are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated on a web page. 
It represents the structure and layout of an element by dividing it into several layers or boxes.

In the box model, each element is represented as a rectangular box, consisting of four main components:

1. Content: It represents the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements. 
   The content area is defined by the width and height properties.

2. Padding: The padding is a transparent area surrounding the content and is used to create space between the content and the border. 
   It is controlled by the padding property and can be set independently for each side (top, right, bottom, left).

3. Border: The border is a line or outline that surrounds the padding and content of an element. 
   It separates the element from its neighboring elements. 
   The border can be customized in terms of its width, style, and color using the border property.

4. Margin: The margin is the outermost layer of the box model and provides space between the element and other elements on the page. 
   It is controlled by the margin property and, similar to padding, can be set independently for each side.

*Note that the background covers a content and a padding in the box model.

Together, these components determine the overall size and spacing of an element. 
The total width of an element is calculated by adding the content width, padding, border, and margin. 
Similarly, the total height is calculated by adding the content height, padding, border, and margin.

By understanding and manipulating the box model, you can control the positioning, layout, and spacing of elements on a web page.

                    <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), position states are used to control the positioning of elements on a web page. There are five main position states available in CSS:

1. Static (default):
    - Static positioning is the default position state for all elements.
    - Elements with static positioning are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
    - Top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect on statically positioned elements.

2. Relative:
    - Relative positioning allows you to position an element relative to its normal position.
    - When an element is set to relative, you can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to adjust its position.
    - Other elements on the page will not be affected by the relative positioning of the element.

3. Absolute:
    - Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow of the document.
    - The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position value other than static) or the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists.
    - Using top, right, bottom, and left properties, you can precisely position the element within its containing block.
    - Absolutely positioned elements are not affected by other elements, and they can overlap other content.

4. Fixed:
    - Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, but the element is positioned relative to the browser window instead of its containing block or ancestor.
    - The fixed element remains in a fixed position even when the page is scrolled.
    - Like absolute positioning, you can use top, right, bottom, and left properties to specify the position of the element.

5. Sticky:
    - Sticky positioning is a mix of relative and fixed positioning.
    - A sticky element is positioned relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor or the viewport if no scrolling ancestor exists.
    - Initially, the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, but as the page is scrolled, it "sticks" 
      to the specified position until it reaches a defined boundary.
    - To create a sticky element, you need to set the top, right, bottom, or left property and also specify a value for one of those properties (e.g., top: 20px).

These position states provide flexibility in arranging and positioning elements within a web page layout, allowing developers to create dynamic and visually appealing designs.

                        class="pre"><code class="language-html">
In CSS, the overflow attribute is used to control how content that exceeds the dimensions of an element is displayed. 
It specifies whether to clip the content, add scrollbars, or automatically display the content in some other way.

The overflow attribute can take several values:

    visible (default): Content is not clipped, and it may extend beyond the dimensions of the element. 
                        This means that content can overlap with other elements.

    hidden: Content that exceeds the dimensions of the element is clipped and not visible. 
            No scrollbars are displayed, and the content is effectively hidden.

    scroll: Content that exceeds the dimensions of the element is clipped, 
            but scrollbars are added to allow users to scroll and view the clipped content.

    auto: Similar to scroll, scrollbars are added when the content exceeds the dimensions of the element. However, 
            if the content fits within the element's dimensions, no scrollbars are displayed.

The overflow attribute can be applied to any block-level element or an element with a specified height and width. 
It is commonly used with elements such as &lt;div> or &lt;iframe> to control the behavior of overflowing content.</code></pre>

    <code>text-align: center</code> will do the horizontal alignment but
    <code>vertical-align: middle</code> will not work here. there are
    couple of different ways to solve this problem and one of them are positioning. 

    // HTML 
    &lt;div class="container">
        &lt;p class="centered">This is some text.&lt;/p>
    &lt;/div>

      
    // 1. Using Position
    .container {
        position: relative;
        height: 300px; /* Set the height of the container div */
      }
      
      .centered {
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        text-align: center; /* Center the text horizontally within the &lt;p> element */
      }
      
    // 2. Using Flex box
    .container {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center; /* Horizontally center the content */
        align-items: center; /* Vertically center the content */
        height: 300px; /* Set the height of the container div */

                    <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
    When you’re wrestling with specificity, trying to override that one
    style, you may be tempted to add !important to your style. Think very
    carefully before you do so! It may seem harmless, but if you do this
    all over the place, you will soon find yourself in a big mess that you
    cannot get out of.<br />
    
    What !important does, is make that particular style have the highest
    specificity possible. Nothing else can override it, apart from another
    !important. You might be able to see where this is going, but once you
    start using them, you’ll almost certainly get into a position where
    you need to override a rule marked as !important, which forces you to
    use another one. And so the cycle continues.<br />
    <code>
    /* high specificity */<br />
    .large .navigation.navigation-large { <br />
    font-size: 2em;<br />
    }<br />
    
    /* will override the above, but it's dangerous! */<br />
    .navigation {<br />
    font-size: 3em !important;<br />

                    </h5>
                    <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
    By default, elements have box-sizing: content-box applied, and only
    the content size is being accounted for.<br />
    <code>box-sizing:</code> border-box changes how the width and height
    of elements are being calculated, border and padding are also being
    included in the calculation.<br />
    The <code>height</code> of an element is now calculated by the
    content's height + vertical padding + vertical border width.<br />
    The <code>width</code> of an element is now calculated by the
    content's width + horizontal padding + horizontal border width. Taking
    into account paddings and borders as part of our box model resonates
    better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.<br />
