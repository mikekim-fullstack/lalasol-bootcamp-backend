        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for.</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            The interviewer is looking for your self-awareness, your knowledge of your strengths and areas of
            development. She will try to assess whether you will be a good fit for the role.
        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer.</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            First of all, this is a great opportunity to tell your story. For strengths, you can share the traits that
            led you to your greatest successes. For the developing areas, demonstrate yourself as a lifetime learner.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With your biggest strength question, it is your opportunity to leave a lasting impression with the
                    interviewer. The best way to approach this is through concrete stories. For example, if your top
                    strength is taking initiatives, you should tell a compelling story where you have gone above and
                    beyond using STAR framework. Please make sure your strength stands out in this story. Even if you
                    think you are slightly better with strength A than strength B, but if you have a more compelling
                    story with B, you should go with B. People do not remember what you say, they remember your stories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that your strengths are directly related to the role and set you apart from others. The
                    weaknesses should be relayed in such a way that they do not have a fatal impact on your role. It’s
                    important to show that you have taken steps to improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes, the interviewers only ask about weakness. Do not answer the question directly if you can.
                    Share that you think strength and weakness are a great combo and ask the interviewer if you can talk
                    about both. In most cases, the interviewer will happily agree and you will take the question to the
                    course that is favorable to you. Of course, if the time is tight, answer the question directly, but
                    again, emphasizing on your actions to improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even if you are not asked to share your strengths, try to find opportunities to share your stories
                    of successes and make connection between the successes and your strengths.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>Too shy to talk about what you are really good at. Do not be shy. The interviewers will not know
                    your strengths if you do not tell them a compelling story. Before your interviews, get your strength
                    story ready, sharp and concise.</li>
                <li>Do not pick up strengths that are entirely unrelated to the job. The interviewers are here to gather
                    information to make hiring recommendations, not for pure entertainment. So pick up strengths that
                    are important in a professional setting, such as your ability to learn, collaborate, execute,
                    innovate, lead, etc.</li>
                <li>Ingenuine or clichéd weaknesses. A common example is that I work too hard. All interviewers know it
                    is made up. Let us face it. We all have a few true weaknesses. Do not think your answer to this
                    question is doomed to impact you negatively. Please have the coverage to make lemonade from a lemon.
                    Turn this question into what you have learned about yourself and how you enriched your skills after
                    you discovered the weakness. That will impress the interviewers a lot more, trust me.</li>

            </ul>
