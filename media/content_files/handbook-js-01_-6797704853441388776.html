            <p class="summary">JavaScript is the most popular client-side scripting language.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is the most popular and widely used client-side scripting language. Client-side scripting
                refers to scripts that run within your web browser. JavaScript is designed to add interactivity and
                dynamic effects to the web pages by manipulating the content returned from a web server.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was originally developed as LiveScript by Netscape in the mid 1990s. It was later renamed to
                JavaScript in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. Now JavaScript is the standard client-side
                scripting language for web-based applications, and it is supported by virtually all web browsers
                available today, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, etc.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and it also has some similarities in syntax to Java
                programming language. But, JavaScript is not related to Java in any way.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is officially maintained by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) as ECMAScript.
                ECMAScript 6 (or ES6) is the latest major version of the ECMAScript standard.</p>

            <h2>What You Can Do with JavaScript</h2>
            <p>There are lot more things you can do with JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can modify the content of a web page by adding or removing elements.</li>
                <li>You can change the style and position of the elements on a web page.</li>
                <li>You can monitor events like mouse click, hover, etc. and react to it.</li>
                <li>You can perform and control transitions and animations.</li>
                <li>You can create alert pop-ups to display info or warning messages to the user.</li>
                <li>You can perform operations based on user inputs and display the results.</li>
                <li>You can validate user inputs before submitting it to the server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The list does not end here, there are many other interesting things that you can do with JavaScript. You

            <h2>What This Tutorial Covers</h2>
            <p>This JavaScript tutorial series covers all the fundamental programming concepts, including data types,
                operators, creating and using variables, generating outputs, structuring your code to make decisions in
                your programs or to loop over the same block of code multiple times, creating and manipulating strings
                and arrays, defining and calling functions, and so on.</p>
            <p>Once you're comfortable with the basics, you'll move on to next level that explains the idea of objects,
                the Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM), as well as how to make use of the native
                JavaScript objects like Date, Math, etc., and perform type conversions.</p>
            <p>Finally, you'll explore some advanced concepts like event listeners, event propagation, borrowing methods
                from other objects, hoisting behavior of JavaScript, encoding and decoding JSON data, as well as
                detailed overview of new features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (or ES6).</p>
