                Semantic HTML is a coding style.
                It is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the content.
                For example: In semantic HTML &lt;b> &lt;/b> tag is not used for bold statement
                as well as &lt;i> &lt;/i> tag is used for italic. Instead of these we use
                &lt;strong> &lt;/strong> and &lt;em> &lt;/em> tags.

                A block-level element is drawn as a block that stretches to fill the full width available to it i.e,
                the width of its container and will always start on a new line.
                Elements that are block-level by default: &lt;div>, &lt;img>, &lt;section>, &lt;form>, &lt;nav>.

                Inline elements are drawn where they are defined and only take up space that is absolutely needed.
                The easiest way to understand how they work is to look at how text flows on a page.
                Examples of elements that are inline by default: &lt;span>, &lt;b>, &lt;strong>, &lt;a>, &lt;input>.

                HTML5 was designed to replace both HTML 4, XHTML, and the HTML DOM Level 2.

Major goals of the HTML specification were to:

* Deliver rich content (graphics, movies, etc.) without the need for additional plugins (e.g., Flash).
* Provide better semantic support for web page structure through the introduction of new structural element tags.
* Provide a stricter parsing standard to simplify error handling, ensure more consistent cross-browser behavior, and simplify backward compatibility with documents written to older standards.
* Provide better cross-platform support (i.e., to work well whether running on a PC, Tablet, or Smartphone).

                With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.

                Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request.
                Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.

                Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.

                Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.

                window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
                window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

HTML5’s Geolocation API lets users share their physical location with chosen web sites.
JavaScript can capture a user’s latitude and longitude and can send it to the back-end web server to enable
location-aware features like finding local businesses or showing their location on a map.

Today, most browsers and mobile devices support the Geolocation API.
The Geolocation API works with a new property of the global navigator object.

A Geolocation object can be created as follows:

var geolocation = navigator.geolocation;
The geolocation object is a service object that allows widgets to retrieve information
about the geographic location of the user’s device.

                Putting &lt;link>s in the head is part of proper specification in building an optimized website.
                When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously;
                HTML creates the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).
                Both are needed to create the visuals in a website, allowing for a quick "first meaningful paint" timing.
                This progressive rendering is a category optimization sites are measured in their performance scores.
                Putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is what prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers.
                Some browsers block rendering to avoid having to repaint elements of the page if their styles change.
                The user is then stuck viewing a blank white page. Other times there can be flashes of unstyled content (FOUC),
                which can shows a webpage with no styling applied.

                Placing &lt;script>s just before &lt;/body>

                &lt;script>s block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed.
                Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.

                Place library script such as the jQuery library in the head section.
                Also, placing &lt;script>s at the bottom means that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed.
                This ensures your code that needs to manipulate DOM elements will not throw and error and halt the entire script.
                If you need to put &lt;script> in the &lt;head>, use the defer attribute, which will achieve the same effect of downloading and running the script only after the HTML is parsed.

                &lt;script> - HTML parsing is blocked, the script is fetched and executed immediately,
                HTML parsing resumes after the script is executed.

                &lt;script async> - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed
                as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes).
                Use async when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example, analytics.

                &lt;script defer> - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed
                when the page has finished parsing. If there are multiple of them, each deferred script is
                executed in the order they were encoun­tered in the document. If a script relies on a fully-parsed DOM,
                the defer attribute will be useful in ensuring that the HTML is fully parsed before executing.
                There's not much difference in putting a normal &lt;script> at the end of &lt;body>.
                A deferred script must not contain document.write.

                Note: The async and defer attrib­utes are ignored for scripts that have no src attribute.
