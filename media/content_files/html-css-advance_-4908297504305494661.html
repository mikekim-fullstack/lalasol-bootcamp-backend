                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
                Making a website responsive means the some elements will respond by
      adapting its size or other functionality according to the device's
      screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries,
      for example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.<br />


      A mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we
      should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only
      add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the
      previous example:<br />

      A mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:<br />

      It's more performant on mobile devices, since all the rules applied
      for them don't have to be validated against any media queries.<br />
      It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.<br />

                HTML5 was designed to replace both HTML 4, XHTML, and the HTML DOM Level 2.

Major goals of the HTML specification were to:

* Deliver rich content (graphics, movies, etc.) without the need for additional plugins (e.g., Flash).
* Provide better semantic support for web page structure through the introduction of new structural element tags.
* Provide a stricter parsing standard to simplify error handling, ensure more consistent cross-browser behavior, and simplify backward compatibility with documents written to older standards.
* Provide better cross-platform support (i.e., to work well whether running on a PC, Tablet, or Smartphone).

                Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request.
                Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.

                Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.

                Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.

                window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date

HTML5’s Geolocation API lets users share their physical location with chosen web sites.
JavaScript can capture a user’s latitude and longitude and can send it to the back-end web server to enable
location-aware features like finding local businesses or showing their location on a map.

Today, most browsers and mobile devices support the Geolocation API.
The Geolocation API works with a new property of the global navigator object.

A Geolocation object can be created as follows:

var geolocation = navigator.geolocation;
The geolocation object is a service object that allows widgets to retrieve information
about the geographic location of the user’s device.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
                Putting &lt;link>s in the head is part of proper specification in building an optimized website.
                When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously;
                HTML creates the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).
                Both are needed to create the visuals in a website, allowing for a quick "first meaningful paint" timing.
                This progressive rendering is a category optimization sites are measured in their performance scores.
                Putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is what prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers.
                Some browsers block rendering to avoid having to repaint elements of the page if their styles change.
                The user is then stuck viewing a blank white page. Other times there can be flashes of unstyled content (FOUC),
                which can shows a webpage with no styling applied.

                Placing &lt;script>s just before &lt;/body>

                &lt;script>s block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed.
                Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.

                Place library script such as the jQuery library in the head section.
                Also, placing &lt;script>s at the bottom means that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed.
                This ensures your code that needs to manipulate DOM elements will not throw and error and halt the entire script.
                If you need to put &lt;script> in the &lt;head>, use the defer attribute, which will achieve the same effect of downloading and running the script only after the HTML is parsed.

                &lt;script async> - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed
                as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes).
                Use async when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example, analytics.

                &lt;script defer> - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed
                when the page has finished parsing. If there are multiple of them, each deferred script is
                executed in the order they were encoun­tered in the document. If a script relies on a fully-parsed DOM,
                the defer attribute will be useful in ensuring that the HTML is fully parsed before executing.
                There's not much difference in putting a normal &lt;script> at the end of &lt;body>.
                A deferred script must not contain document.write.

                <i>Resetting</i> - Resetting is meant to strip all default browser
                styling on elements. For e.g. margins, paddings, font-sizes of all

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
                CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It
          is a commonly-used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). How to
          implement it:<br />

          1. Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and
          generate the appropriate CSS for it.<br />
          2. Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with
          background-image, background-position and background-size properties
          defined.<br />
          3. To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.<br />

          Advantages: <br />

          - Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one
          single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading
          multiple images is no longer much of an issue.<br />
          - Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until needed,
          such as images that only appear upon :hover pseudo-states. Blinking
          wouldn't be seen.<br />

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
                - After identifying the issue and the offending browser, use a
                separate style sheet that only loads when that specific browser is
                being used. - This technique requires server-side rendering though.<br />
                - Use libraries like Bootstrap that already handles these styling
                issues for you.<br />
                - Use autoprefixer to automatically add vendor prefixes to your
                code.<br />
                Use Reset CSS or Normalize.css.<br />
                - If you're using Postcss (or a similar transpiling library), there
                may be plugins which allow you to opt in for using modern CSS syntax
                (and even W3C proposals) that will transform those sections of your
                code into corresponding safe code that will work in the targets you've

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-html">
                <i>Advantages:</i><br />
                - CSS is made more maintainable.<br />
                - Easy to write nested selectors. <br />
                - Variables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across
                different projects.<br />
                - Mixins to generate repeated CSS.<br />
                - Sass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration
                easier and less verbose.<br />
                - Splitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up
                too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS
                file.<br />
                <i>Disadvantages:</i><br />
                - Requires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be
                slow.<br />
                - Not writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by
                using something like postcss-loader with webpack, you can write
                potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS
                variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, you're learning new skills
                that could pay off if/when they become standardized.

                    considerations do you make while building a web application or site?

                <i>UI:</i> Depending on your audience, accessibility can be your
                biggest challenge and resources such as http://a11yproject.com are
                great in suggesting patterns to achieve whats needed. Beyond that, a
                pleasant palette and intuitive interfaces are the foundation, which
                arise from well developed style guides containing code snippets that
                help developers quickly deliver features with pre-themed UI elements
                that alleviate common pain points such as non-conforming elements that
                may distract stake holders during the iteration and approval
                process.<br />
                <i>Security:</i>
                - Login pages should be encrypted<br />
                - Data validation should be done server-side<br />
                - Manage your Web site via encrypted connections<br />
                <i>Performance:</i> Concatenation and minification of JS and CSS
                files, delivering SVG images wherever possible, icon fonts, use
                sprites as necessary and compressing images.<br />
                <i>SEO:</i> When it comes to SEO, I refer to my approach as “the new
                old school.” That is, I don’t believe there is any “magic in your
                meta” tags and I encourage business owners to simply create content
                that is relevant to your business, write clearly and often, advertise
                when necessary, make sure your site is mobile friendly, that sharing
                your content is easy, and you have control of your Google, Twitter,
                Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, Foursquare, Pinterest, Instagram (insert hot
                new here…) accounts, and everything really does fall into place. As
                your business grows, more visitors come, more people share and the
                search engines notice.<br />
                <i>Maintainability and Technology Considerations:</i> Use tooling that
                is more flexible and adhere’s to a standard. A great example of this
                is PostCSS, where the concept is, you write plain old CSS – and NEW
                CSS as well, including syntax not yet implemented in browsers and let
                a plugin process your css and manipulate the output so it’s browser
                ready. Then as time passes, W3C syntax is agreed upon, pre-fix use
                subsides, and you can re-process your CSS with less and less
                manipulation.
