        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            On one side, the interviewer is giving you an opportunity to ask questions so that you have a better
            understanding of the company. On the other hand, the interviewer is also going to form her opinion about how
            excited you are with the company, based on the questions you have asked.
        </div>
        <div class="img"><img src="../images/questions.png"></div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            You should think about two things here. One is to ask questions that you still have about the company and
            the role. Just as the company is interviewing you, you are interviewing it as well. The other is to ask
            questions that demonstrate your passion, knowledge and thought leadership in this space.

            <p>If you do not have questions or your questions are very superficial, it will be a clear indicator that
                you are not highly interested in the role, or you are not a curious person. Both cases are bad signs to
                an interviewer.</p>
            <p>Below are some sample questions that can help you get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I read the news that xxx is also starting a similar service. What is your take on their move?</li>
                <li>What big trends do you see in xxx space in the next 3 years?</li>
                <li>What 3-5 words will you use to describe the teamâ€™s culture?</li>
                <li>What are the biggest challenges that someone in this role will face?</li>
                <li>What does your day look like?</li>
                <li>How satisfied is the team with their career development?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>No questions: this shows that you have not researched the company and the role properly, or you are
                    not interested.</li>
                <li>Asking very generic questions that can be answered using Google search. This is a very precious
                    moment for you to get meaningful information about the role. Please do not waste it.</li>
                <li>Ask too detail questions, such as benefits. This is not the time. You have plenty of time to ask
                    about benefits after you get the offer.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>This is one question that everyone will ask :)</li>
            </ul>
