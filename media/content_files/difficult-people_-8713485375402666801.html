                Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you
                do?
            </div>

            <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong></div>
            <div class="box-item">
                <li>This person is hard to work with,</li>
                <li>This person does not know you or your project,</li>
                <li>This person is very swamped, and your ask is not even close to the top of their priority list,</li>
                <li>You have done something that offended them, but you are not even aware, or</li>
                <li>Their manager and your manager are not aligned. The person wants to help but got a different
                    direction from their manager.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="img"><img src="../images/teamwork.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                The interviewers are looking for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your action to uncover the reasons behind this person’s lack of response,</li>
                <li>Your concrete steps to win over their support and response, and</li>
                <li>Your ability to seek collaboration when the other party does not seem like collaborative.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
            <div class="box-item">
                You should follow the STAR method to explain the situation, in particular, what actions have you taken
                to uncover the reasons behind this person’s lack of response and take appropriate follow-up steps. For
                example,
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>If your project is not high on the person's priority, you should find ways to get priorities
                    aligned. You may be able to do this by stopping by their desk or leveraging your manager or their
                    manager’s help.</li>
                <li>If they are swamped with high priority deliverables, can you ask another person to help?
                    Alternatively, can you recommend someone else to help you?</li>
                <li>If the managers are not aligned, should you try to talk to the manager directly or push your manager
                    to work with the other manager to get aligned?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, you need to be empathetic to understand why the person is not very responsive. Do not draw a
                conclusion that the other person is hard to work with without looking more into their challenges. Once
                you have a better understanding of the situation, you can come up with the right ways to get help on
                your project by being assertive without being aggressive.</p>

            <div class="box-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Quickly jumping to a conclusion that the person is hard to work with.</li>
                    <li>Relying too much on escalation.</li>
                    <li>Showing aggression in your communication.</li>
                </ul>
