        <p><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> We all want to work with strong individuals, and most
            of us do not want to work with jerks no matter how strong this individual is. When an interviewer asks for
            this question, she is trying to understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is your leadership style?</li>
            <li>Will you be a good fit for the company?</li>
            <li>Are you easy to work with?</li>
            <li>Does she want you to be her teammate?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> Be genuine. Share the true leadership traits that you have heard
            others describe you. Do not try to be someone you are not. Use some light-weight examples to support your
            statement, but do not go into too much detail. The interviewer is asking for others perception about you.
            Too many details imply, you are trying too hard. For example, if you say you bring positive energy and fun
            to the team, you can give examples on how many team events you organize, either ad-hoc or planned, but no
            need to go into specific detail for the events since they are not important for the question. Again, 3 is
            the magic number. Please pick up three things to describe your own leadership style. At the end, do a brief
            summary so that the interviewer has the best chance to capture and appreciate it.
        </p>
        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Too verbose, unnecessarily get into too much detail</li>
            <li>Answering the question without examples. Do not be fooled by this question. It does not ask for examples
                specifically, but it does not mean the interviewer does not expect it from you.</li>
            <li>Pick up controversial leadership dimension. Please note the interviewer is also assessing whether she
                wants to be your teammate.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatâ€™s your leadership style?</li>
            <li>Which leadership trait do you wish to have but you do not possess today?</li>
