        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            The interviewer is looking for the motivational factors that keep you going. The interviewer will try to
            aggregate your answers, your strengths, and your background to form an overall view of you and assess how
            well you will fit in the teamâ€™s needs.
        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            Talk about what you care most deeply, why it matters to you, and how you have committed 100% of your energy
            to do things you care, no matter if it is technology advancement, business success, amazing user experience,
            or learning new things to expedite your growth.

            <p>It is ok to joke it is the kids and the alarm that get you up, but please do not stop there :) The
                interviewers want to know more about what drives you.</p>

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
            <ul>
                <li>The answer is completely unrelated to the job. Yes, you have your passion, but how will it
                    contribute to your success on the job? Will it become a distraction from your work performance?</li>
                <li>Answer targeted entirely towards job description. It is a good idea to connect your answer to the
                    job, but if it is overdone, the interviewer will know you are not being genuine and trying too hard
                    to get the job.</li>
                <li>Broad and generic answers that do not seem to be very sincere and genuine. If you are unable to
                    communicate passionately, the interviewer will think either you are not able to communicate well or
                    you are not giving a genuine response.</li>
