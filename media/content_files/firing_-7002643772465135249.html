        </div>
        <p>
            <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> Firing is one of the most challenging tasks that a
            manager faces. If done improperly, it could trigger various complications. From oneâ€™s behavior in a
            performance management or firing experience, one can tell how strong you are as a manager. In this question,
            the interviewer is looking for evidence to assess:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your philosophy for performance management,</li>
            <li>Hands-on experience with performance management,</li>
            <li>Empathy with the involved employees, and</li>
            <li>Partnership with HR to make and execute tough but necessary decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img"><img src="../images/fire-someone.png"></div>

        <p>
            <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> First of all, give a direct answer on your experience with firing
            and performance management. Then pick up one or two examples to go into detail. A typical performance
            management case involves the following steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The manager observed performance challenges, provide actionable feedback to help the individual to grow.
            </li>
            <li>The manager and the individual dive deep to analyze the performance, assess whether the individual is
                set for success. If not, apply some adjustments if available.</li>
            <li>When situation does not improve, the manager usually first encourages the employee to reflect if this is
                the right environment for his/her success. After that, the manager can trigger PEP and/or PIP process
                for larger companies. For smaller companies, this step is often skipped.</li>
            <li>If the performance still does not improve after all the effort, it is time for the manager to make the
                hard decision, work with HR to execute the decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since firing and performance management are very sensitive topics, it often requires close partnership with
            HR. Please make sure to mention about your collaboration with HR on this.
        </p>
        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Simply say the employee did not perform and move forward to fire. No indication that you have tried to
                hear the employee out and create opportunity for her to improve and succeed.
            </li>
            <li>Do not take partnership from HR</li>
            <li>Expect HR to do the job for you. Some managers delegate this to HR. The reality is that managers should
                own performance management no matter how hard it is. HR will only be there to support.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:.</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you put anyone on PIP? How did it play out?</li>
            <li>Which one is harder? Hire or fire? Why?</li>
        </ul>
